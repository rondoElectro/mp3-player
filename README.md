As a 2000's child, I grew up around cool technology product design, and it was always my dream to collect them all. <br>
Now i have a cute small collection, and the ipod, apple's mp3 player is one of them, so i took some inspiration to build a digital version, and show my favorite song as an extra.<br>
Also, I'm planning on adding some functionality and design features.
*already working on some of them!
